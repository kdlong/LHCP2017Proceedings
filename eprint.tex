\begin{Abstract}

We summarize recent results from the CMS experiment on the simultaneous 
production of multiple vector bosons in proton-proton collisions at the 
CERN LHC. Unfolded differential distributions are presented at 8 TeV for
$WZ$ production and at 13 TeV for ZZ production.
Cross section measurements are presented for ZZ, $Z(\nu\nu)\gamma$ and 
$WZ$ production at 8 and 13 TeV. Limits on anomalous triple gauge couplings
are presented for WV ($V = W,Z \rightarrow q\bar{q}$ at 8 and 13 TeV.

\section{Introduction}

HERE IS YOUR INTRODUCTION, REPLACE THE TEXT

The program will be devoted to a review of the latest experimental and theoretical results on hadron collider physics and a discussion on the outlook for the coming years. The conference intends to provide a lively discussion between experimenters and theorists on topics such as the Standard Model Physics and Beyond, the Higgs Boson, Supersymmetry and Heavy Ion Physics and planning for the high luminosity upgrades.

\section{Observations}

REPLACE THE TEXT, FIGURE and TABLE.

Observation of the Higgs Boson,  \cite{Aad:2012tfa},\cite{Chatrchyan:2012ufa}.
